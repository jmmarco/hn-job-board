# Hacker News Job Board

Jobs posts all across the world are posted to Hacker News each month by an automated user with id `whoishiring`. This app pulls the latest one for each month and displays them for you.

## How does it works
Posts are retrieved using the official [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)
